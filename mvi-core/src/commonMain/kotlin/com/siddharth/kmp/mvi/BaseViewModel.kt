/**
 * MVI base. `S` = UiState, `E` = Effect, `A` = user Action.
 *
 * Two effect channels with distinct delivery contracts:
 * - [emitEffect] → a buffered [Channel] consumed **exactly once** by the screen's `LaunchedEffect`.
 *   Use for navigation, toasts, one-shot dialogs, things that must fire once and never replay.
 * - [emitBroadcast] → a [SharedFlow] (no replay, drops oldest on overflow) that **survives config
 *   change** and is delivered to whatever collector is active. Use for fire-and-forget signals where
 *   a missed emission is acceptable but new collectors should still receive subsequent ones.
