/**
 * Generic Information-Set Monte Carlo Tree Search shell. Knows nothing about any specific game —
 * every domain concept ([rules], leaf evaluation, rollout policy) is injected by the caller.
 *
 * Determinization (sampling a consistent full [State] from a hidden-information [View]) is
 * deliberately OUT of scope here: [search]'s [determinize] parameter is called once per iteration to
 * supply that fresh determinized root, since HOW hidden information is sampled (belief models,
 * priors, ...) is domain-specific and stays out of this shell.
 *
 * [rolloutPolicy] is a FACTORY, not a single instance, and is invoked once per rollout ply. This is
 * load-bearing for callers that reseed a fresh policy per ply (e.g. from a dedicated RNG stream) —
 * a single shared, continuously-advancing rollout policy instance can measurably weaken deeper
 * searches versus per-ply reseeding. Keeping it a factory lets a caller reproduce exact seeding while
 * this shell stays domain-agnostic (the factory closes over the caller's own RNG; the shell never
 * sees a seed).
